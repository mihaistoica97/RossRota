# RossRota
A program that helps figure out Ross' rota from a picture


TO DO:
1) Order data by boundary box. Currently data is out of order after a certain point, sort this by position and splitting everything into rows
2) Merge "day" and "off" messed up data. Currently some readings are split, mostly the "Day off" squares of the rota
